# PHP
I'm going to share a few screenshots I've taken while learning "<b>PHP</b>"<br>
I'm using VSCode for coding and WinSCP to update a local directory with my VPS server<br>
by the way web server I'm using is Apache and it's running on Linux Ubuntu<br>
<br>
#Basic PHP code and the rendered page<br>
The first thing you'll learn when working with PHP is that unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which<br>
are handled by your web browser, PHP scripts make use of the PHP interpreter, so, first you must install php<br>
and only after that, you'll be able to use php, the interpreter process the code and return the results to the <br>
web server, in our case Apache, and Apache will pass it to the web browser<br>
